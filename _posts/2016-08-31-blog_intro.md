## Why Blog?
Over the past few months I have been working on an IoT project that I hope someday
to actually bring to market. In this process I have learned so much about
a number of technologies and after a little prodding from
[@JonasRosland](https://twitter.com/jonasrosland) of [EMC {code}](https://emccode.com/) fame
I decided to share what I am learning and the progress of my project.


## Meet The Lemmy Light
You may have noticed the Lemmings throughout the blog (sidenote: this is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based blog that I will write about sometime in the future) which I have adopted as a sort of mascot for the Lemmy Light.  The Lemmy Light is/will be a light that helps parents sleep through the night, provide visual reassurance/guidance to their little one that all is well, help their children learn proper sleep hygiene from a young age and provide important environmental information about the child's sleep environmental to the parents.  The genesis of the whole thing is our five year-old darling (most of the time) little girl who is also an early riser.  She has been known to wake up as early as 5:00am and when there isn't light outside the window her first instinct is to yell out to the baby monitor "Is it wakeup time yet?" which is better than the door kick-in disruption of my day but shatters our restful sleep nonetheless and often leaves poor momma unable to go back to sleep.  I have been messing around with microcontrollers and in particular the [Particle Photon](http://particle.io) for awhile so I knew I could put together something to give the little one a simple Green, Yellow or Red visual cue as to if she can get up or not.  My initially very simple project has grown over the past few months into a full blown Thing of the Internet and potentially something many parents would buy.  I won't be spending much time on the specifics of the Lemmy Light and its full capabilities because I would rather not write a roadmap for how to rip off my product should I start to get some traction but what I will be covering is the development of most of the features, the mobile app and the supporting platform/s I will use to get to a fully baked prototype ready for scaled production.  

## IoT Has a Secret You Should Know
This won't be exclusively about the technologies because the dirty little secret of the Internet of Things is that the traditional retail model simply doesn't work.  These are products that require ongoing services, customers expect fixes and new features to be rolled out over time so the vendor to customer relationship exists far beyond the point of sale and then there are the costs of service for said product.  As I make selections about using a platform or service vs building something myself I will account for those costs and keep a running tally of what it really costs to support the Lemmy Light post-sale.  This is the quintessential Buy vs Build conversation I have on a regular basis with customers in my day-job so now that the shoe is on the other foot I intend to show the business impact (or at least potential) that Buying vs Building will have on the sustainability of the Lemmy Light.  A prime example of failing to account for this or how your favorite product being bought up by a mega-co isn't always good for you is the [Revolv story](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11362928/google-nest-revolv-shutdown-smart-home-products).  

By now I am sure you are wondering how Lemmy came to be named as such so here it goes.  The Lemmy Light is short for "The please for the love of all that is sacred please LEMME sleep Light."  I think Lemmy Light rolls of the tongue a little easier and is also tongue in cheek so bonus in my mind!  Looking forward to sharing what I am learning and how things are progressing.  

See v0.01 of the Lemmy Light in action (if you promise to ignore whatever is playing in the background then I will promise to take better pics/videos in the future).
