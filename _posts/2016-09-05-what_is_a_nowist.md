Not long ago I happened to stumble upon a great TED Talk by Joi Ito where he explains that to become an innovator you must become a 'Nowist'.  Shortly after seeing this talk I did a little research and Joi has become somewhat of a personal hero of mine because of his history and the aforementioned TED Talk.  I highly recommend that anyone that wants to be seen as innovative or wants to make something watch this.  I particularly enjoy his view on education and learning...


> I'm a three-time college dropout, so learning over education is very near and dear to my heart, but to me, education is what people do to you and learning is what you do to yourself.

> And it feels like, and I'm biased, it feels like they're trying to make you memorize the whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play, and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone, and it feels like they assume you're going to be on top of some mountain all by yourself with a number 2 pencil trying to figure out what to do when in fact you're always going to be connected, you're always going to have friends, and you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it, and what you need to learn is how to learn. In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs when we started three years ago, I would argue that we probably as a group know more than any other organization about how to collect data and publish data and do citizen science.
