If you can look at a star-filled night sky and not find yourself in awe...then we won't get along.

![image-left](/images/Us_teaser-2.jpg){: .align-left}I find this to be incredibly awkward but I suppose if I expect to have people give a damn about what I have to say then I should at least explain who I am.  I am a father, a Marine, a Rescue Diver, licensed Sky Diver, a Cloud Architect and all around piddler; to summarize myself into one sentence.  I began my career in IT doing desktop support at the tender age of 16 and have been lucky enough to see the industry evolve over the succeeding 21 years in ways I never could have imagined.  I am currently most interested in the Cloud Native movement, API economy and Internet of Things so this blog will focus mostly on those arenas with the occasional foray back to my roots in infrastructure.  Since all of my work history has been in infrastructure I have very little pre-existing knowledge to work from which is why I am enjoying this all so much.  I believe in learning at every opportunity and that doing beats reading every time.

In my off-time I work on the Lemmy Light Project, spend time with my family and always enjoy a good movie.  I am a self-declared 'documentary junkie' and there aren't many days when I don't at least start one at bedtime.  Some of my favorites are "How the Universe Works", "The Universe" and the many separate Ancient documentaries on Rome, China, Japan, Europe, etc.
